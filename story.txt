	There was once a child who wanted to taste the fountain of youth.
Typically eternity's cup is sought by those who feel the pursuant breath of death
closing in, but not in this case. At this stage of her life, death was nothing
more than a distant story to the girl -- a villain in a wonderful adventure, just
like in the exciting stories she listened to whenever she went to sleep. And children
are driven by the most imaginative dreams. So where others desired to become princesses
or ride noble steed, this girl sought to defeat death. All she had was a map to the
living waters and some dry, absorbent cereal fashioned into a crispy spoon.
